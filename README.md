# `.IdeaVIMrc`

I have configured Vim keybindings for CLion. Including **AI powered code
actions**, **Code Analyzer Tools**, **Easy Navigation**, **General Popups**

To demonstrate what do I mean is that you can use some keybinding to open the
popup which comes out when you click the entity with right mouse click.

I cannot say that It feels like native vim. Because the features are not enough
fit in a keyboard. It feels like hybrid Vim & IDE with popups which are
controlled by keystrokes (arrows in general) with the bindings that open them

Some of the integrated Vim-like features:

- File Navigation:
  - File Search
  - Tab Navigation
- Code actions
  - AI
  - Normal
- Code Navigation
  - Built-in Jumps
- Search buffer
  - File
- Code Generator Features
- Integrated AI Assistant
- Code Analyzer
- Theme Selector
- Color Picker

> **Note**: Some comments are included when needed

And so on. The code almost entirely consist `map` calls so self explanatory.

Code respects to your IDE settings by `<Leader>` key mappings which does not
conflict with the existing ones.
